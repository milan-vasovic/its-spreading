            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Game Summary Pitch:</strong><br>
                "It's Spreading" is a 2D pixel art game that unfolds the story of an unending invasion of slime on
                humanity's last line of defense. Players can select from various heroes, each with unique abilities and
                perks, to combat the relentless onslaught of slimes and strive to eliminate them before it's too late.
                Time is of the essence! Immerse yourself in the pixelated world as you take on the role of a hero
                standing against the relentless tide of slime invaders. Choose your character wisely, considering their
                distinct abilities and perks, and engage in an epic battle for survival. The more you catch, the more
                glory you will have. Glory unlocks new things.</p>
            <p><strong>Player Experience:</strong><br>
                Player at first can choose only one character. After playing and collecting glory he will unlock more
                characters. Every character has a unique ability, art style, and music. By progressing further player
                will encounter new cinematics. At the end collected glory will be saved, and player will have option to
                save score. (In the future more content and mechanics requiring more glory to be unlocked)</p>

            <h2>Concept</h2>
            <p><strong>Gameplay Overview:</strong><br>
                The player controls a preselected character and moves from the safe zone to the arena, aiming to hunt
                down a specific kind of slime, otherwise, the player loses life. If lives go to 0, it's game over! Once
                outside the safe zone, the player can't reenter it! Every character has unique abilities and can use
                them a limited number of times, some have more lives! (currently all have same amount) The objective is
                to survive as long as possible, hunt down as much as possible, and do it in the least amount of time.
                Faster equals more points!</p>
            <p><strong>Primary Mechanics:</strong><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Borders: A stopping force to limit players movement inside playable area.</li>
                <li>Slimes: When the player hunts down the correct slime, they earn points and receive a new target.
                    Otherwise, they lose a life, return to the starting position in the safe zone, and lose the game if
                    their lives reach 0.</li>
                <li>Abilities: Different characters possess unique abilities that significantly impact gameplay,
                    providing strategic advantages in various ways.</li>
                <li>Glory: Introduce an in-game currency, perhaps named "Glory," that players earn by successfully
                    catching slimes. Used to unlock new characters abilities and other things.</li>
                <li>Score: Points that accumulate, currently factoring speed of completing round, round and slimes.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Assets</h2>
            <p><strong>Theme Interpretation:</strong><br>
                Itâ€™s spreading. Simple 2D art with the goal of evoking nostalgia and fueling imagination and immersion
                with an element of never ending to add difficulty. The more you progress more will come!</p>
            <p><strong>Design:</strong><br>
                A dark, damp, devastated and medieval environment aimed at enhancing immersion and fantasy, with a
                contrast of vivid colors.</p>
            <p><strong>Audio:</strong><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Music: To enhance the overall theme and vibe of the game, minimalist music will be incorporated,
                    contributing to a subtle and immersive experience. Every character has unique song.</li>
                <li>Sound Effects: To infuse more flair and polish into the gaming experience, a plethora of
                    environmental sound effects will provide weight and feedback to the player's actions. Instead of
                    relying on realistic foley, synthesized blips, bloops, and whooshes are utilized for a more
                    distinctive auditory atmosphere.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Cinematics:</strong><br>
                There are 2 types of cinematics. At the start of the specific rounds (at first, fifth, tenth, fifteenth)
                and after losing the game. Every character has his own cinematics. Some are shared and some are unique
                (purposely left images out from here, as a surprise and something to look forward while playing)</p>

            <h2>Game Experience</h2>
            <p><strong>UI:</strong><br>
                Beside playable area there is also HUD with all important informations such as score, lives, current
                round, current target, round time, abilities and cost and glory. Whole design is simple, minimalistic
                and clear.</p>
            <p><strong>Controls:</strong><br>
                Keyboard, W, A, S, D or arrows for movement, space to use ability, numbers 1, 2 and 3. And key P to
                pause the current game and select other character (feature for testing purposes in this demo, it will
                not show all cinematics with right text when jumping from character to character in game that is in
                progress. Best to explore all by playing. In future it will be changed and adapt in different way)</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am Milan Vasovic, coming from Serbia, a software engineering student. Currently, I am focused on
                becoming a full-stack developer, but gaming is my passion. I have been exposed to the world of
                programming for several years, but I have been working intensively and learning for about 4-5 months
                now. This is the first real game I've made, and also the first project I've participated in. In the
                future, I would like to create more games. I already have some ideas and plans, and I am slowly working
                towards them.</p>
